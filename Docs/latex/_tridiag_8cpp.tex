\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_tridiag}{Tridiag} class for working with tridiagonal matrices. 

This file implements the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_tridiag}{Tridiag}} class, which represents a tridiagonal matrix and provides methods for multiplying the matrix by a vector and solving a system of linear equations using the LU decomposition.
